a-ah.. greetings; the name’s Trotswollop, The Squire

you wouldn’t happen to sell anything useful for a boss, would you?

I just started my internship yesterday and I can’t afford enough education to know what these potions do…

ah… my boss didn’t like that last one i bought… had to shield myself from his wrath..

he said something about needing to boost his image…? I couldn’t hear through the shell.
_mid
my boss didn’t yell at me yesterday, i think you picked a pretty good one!
_god
I owe you one! my boss gave me a “good job” yesterday! 

I have never felt more happy in my life.
_all
anyhow, do you happen to have another one? I’m really counting on you for this one.

_day 1
_all
You. Vendor. 

I’m exhausted, and I’m not here to make friends.

I’m here because I’ve got money and a problem, and you’ve got the solution.

So, fix me something that’ll keep me alert. I’ll be needing my head later.

If you happen to have any pixie sugar, it may pair well with warm vegetables.

You again. 

I don’t know what you gave me last time, but I think it made me sick. So, good first impression.

Listen, I don’t know who you think I am, but I am DEFINITELY not an idiot.

Well, since you’re the only person in this town that sells what I need, I guess I’ve got to get along.

_mid

So.

Whatever you gave me yesterday didn’t quite do it, but at least it wasn’t a total disaster. 

I guess I respect your.. courage.. in not listening to my suggested recipe.

Maybe you thought it would work out. Well, it didn’t. So this time, let’s stick to what works.

... 

I guess I should introduce myself.

_god

Well, I have to hand it to you. You make a good coffee.

Maybe I just think that because you’re the only place around here that sells coffee.

...

No, you’ve got good coffee.

_all
You can call me Clove. It isn’t short for anything, so don’t bother asking.

I’m a healer. Maybe the most vital component of a team of adventurers, but also the least respected. 

You see, these big burly idiots rush into battle and nearly get themselves killed every time!

And what would be the reason they make it out alive?

...

It’s me. 

I thought that was obvious, but I guess you were either too shy to blurt out a guess or just the quiet type.

Well. Guess what the team has me up to now?

That’s right, running errands. Like I’m their mother.

Our alchemist is looking for some sort of corrosive substance, I guess to be used in some sort of weaponry.

For what exactly, I don’t know, but I’ll have to be the one to construct new flesh around their bones.

...

It’s for the greater good.

So yeah, something corrosive.

...

Incredible.

I’ve never seen someone with such dangerous incompetence.

This is the first that anyone on my team has suffered irreparable damage. 

Apparently, that order from the alchemist was VERY important.

I don’t even know what exactly we were fighting.. Memories are hazy..

It took everything we threw at it and dished it back at us. No blade or arrow could pierce its thick coat. 

Maybe if we could’ve melted away some of its protective layers we would’ve come out in better shape.

But at this point, I don’t think the team will be ready for another fight for quite some time.

Some of us may be out for good.

So thanks for that, genius..

It’s a shame the biggest moron in town is also the only one with the goods I need.

_awf

.. 

So, the most I can say is that nobody’s dead.

And it looks like everyone’s going to be ok.

No thanks to you.

No thanks to our alchemist, either. 

If he wanted something acidic he should’ve bought your ingredients and made it himself.

But I guess we all don’t think before we act.

You’re especially guilty of that, as evidenced by your no-brainer concoction you served me yesterday.

However, and despite your mistakes, everyone is going to be ok.

So, I’ll suck it up and fork over some money for one more item.

_mid

Shopkeep.

I appreciate your willingness to experiment, but please don’t treat my requests as a testing opportunity.

I’ve got people that rely on me. 

People that don’t know that they rely on me, yes, but they need me just the same.

So this time, I beg you, please use your head. 

_god

Hello..

Uhh.. You did good.

Sorry, I’m no good at giving thanks because I never get any.

You had just what our alchemist was looking for and we got away from our adventure in pretty good shape.

Though the acid did become a friendly fire problem, as predicted.

So, once again, I had to save their asses..

Really, we couldn’t have done it without you.

I imagine you go pretty unappreciated as a shopkeep yourself.

Thanks. 

I mean that. I think..

_all

Look, what I need from you might be a little bit more complicated than what you’re used to, but I need it.

I think my job is important. 

But I hate it. I honestly do.

I feel so underappreciated, but at the same time I know this town would be rubble without people in my position.

Because without these unruly, moronic “heroes,” all hell would break loose.

All in all, I’m just a bit lost at the moment. I need something to enlighten me. 

Something primitive, in touch with the origins of life itself.

My boys didn’ feel no better with that crap ya fixed up.

Matter o’ fact, they was hardly able to protect me! Old Broadbean had to get his hooves dirty.. But no matter.

Picked some vitamins up at the pharmacy on the way ta yer shop this morn.


_mid

Well, shopkeep, thanks fer nuthin!

My boys jus’ BARELY made it thru last night and they still need somethin’ ta get ‘em back shootin.

Luckily, I got some vitamins at the pharmacy on the way ta yer shop this morn.

And I ain’t too peeved about las’ night neither, so I don’ mind doin’ business with ya once more.

_god

Howdy, NEIGH-bor!! 

I gotta say, yer concoction worked like a charm! My boys felt ready ta take on them ghouls!

Ya got yerself a regular customer now, shopkeep. Congrat-ya-lations!!

But neigh-hey, let’s get down ta business.

_all

I got a feelin’ those ghouls gonna be back tonight with a vengeance..

..and my pea shooters ain’t gonna cover it this time. Broadbean’s gonna have ta find a way ta step in.

Shopkeep, if ya could, help me and my boys survive tonight!

Shopkeep.. I beg ya..

Yer poor service.. It’s killin’ yer pal Broadbean.

Ma boys are droppin’ left and right, leavin’ me helpless..

I’s hurt, in a physical kinda way. But that ain’t even the worst of it..

_awf

...

BY GOD, how are ya the only shopkeep in town?

Never in my ELEVEN YEARS of age have I been swindled like this!!

Yer actions have con-sequences mister.. CON-SEQUENCES!!!

Tragic con-sequences...

_mid

Hiya, shopkeep. 

Now, I understand yer tryin’, but yer wares ain’t doin’ me no good! 

If yer stone-cold, silent demeanor weren’t so charmin’, I’d be squealin’ at ya..

But Broadbean ain’t got no time to squeal today.. There’s more important matters at hand..

_god

Howdy, howdy, howdy, shopkeep! 

Huh.. Ain’t that funny. We’s practically stable-mates and I don’t even know yer name!!

Well, that ain’t too important. We got a problem to sort out.

Ya see, ya did all ya could to help, but some things jus’ can’t be helped..

Some things is in-evitable..

_all

Ya see, I’m real beat up over somethin..

My oldest and most prized pea shootin’ boy perished last night.. Ain’t nothin’ nobody could do ta stop it.

OH SHOPKEEP, WON’T YA HELP A SAD OLD HORSE GET BACK TA NORMAL?

Yer pal Broadbean’s not gonna survive another ghoul attack without the right mindset..
