a-ah.. greetings; the name’s Trotswollop, The Squire

you wouldn’t happen to sell anything useful for a boss, would you?

I just started my internship yesterday and I can’t afford enough education to know what these potions do…

ah… my boss didn’t like that last one i bought… had to shield myself from his wrath..

he said something about needing to boost his image…? I couldn’t hear through the shell.

my boss didn’t yell at me yesterday, i think you picked a pretty good one!
_god
I owe you one! my boss gave me a “good job” yesterday! 

I have never felt more happy in my life.
_all
anyhow, do you happen to have another one? I’m really counting on you for this one.
